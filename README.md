# Weather-and-climate-change 
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to engineer a Knowledge Graph which models various meteorological
facilities, and, thereby, models the climate (and possible climate change) in a territory (e.g., Trentino)
based on a precise set of user queries and requirements, namely, Competency Questions (CQs),
which the Knowledge Graph can answer, eg -
● Where are the weather stations located in Trentino?
● What was the average temperature and rainfall in Trentino over the past 10 years?
● Which areas in Trentino have seen the highest increase in temperature over time?
● Which locations show signs of climate change based on long-term weather data?
